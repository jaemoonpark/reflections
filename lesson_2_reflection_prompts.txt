Initializing a repository is neccessary to create a git repository. It takes a snapshot of the current directory.

-----

*git commit -> creates a commit of the files in the staging area.
*git add -filename- -> adds file to staging area
*git reset -filename- -> removes file from staging area
Staging Area-> marks file to be committed. Useful when wanting to commit only certain files.

*git init- Initilizates new empty git repository
*git status â€” shows which files have changed since the last commit. also shows files in working directory as well as files that are in and not in the staging area.
